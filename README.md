# 📊 Stock Price Prediction from Financial News  

## Project Description  
Our team uses publicly available financial news headlines and historical stock market data to analyze and predict short-term stock price movements. Leveraging machine learning techniques such as sentiment analysis, feature engineering, and deep learning models—including pre-trained language models (LLMs) like FinBERT—you will build a pipeline that extracts market signals from news content. This will help address the real-world challenge of interpreting financial news for timely investment decisions.  

Our main objectives are to clean and preprocess textual data, apply LLMs for sentiment or embedding extraction, align it with market data, and build a predictive model to forecast next-day stock trends. One approach could be to treat this as a classification problem, though other strategies are possible.

## Objectives  
-  **Preprocess** financial news text and align it with stock market data.  
-  **Apply LLMs (e.g., FinBERT)** for sentiment scoring and embedding extraction.  
- **Engineer features** that capture market sentiment and trading signals.  
- **Train predictive models** (classification & deep learning) to forecast next-day price trends.  
-  **Evaluate model performance** using accuracy, precision, recall, and related metrics.
