# 📊 Stock Price Prediction from Financial News  

## Overview  
This project explores the intersection of **financial news and market prediction**, aiming to forecast **short-term stock price movements** using **machine learning** and **large language models (LLMs)**.  

Our pipeline integrates **news sentiment analysis** with **historical stock data** to extract meaningful signals and deliver predictions that could support **timely and informed investment decisions**.  

---

## Objectives  
-  **Preprocess** financial news text and align it with stock market data.  
-  **Apply LLMs (e.g., FinBERT)** for sentiment scoring and embedding extraction.  
- **Engineer features** that capture market sentiment and trading signals.  
- **Train predictive models** (classification & deep learning) to forecast next-day price trends.  
-  **Evaluate model performance** using accuracy, precision, recall, and related metrics.
